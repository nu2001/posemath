# Posemath Library

Posemath library is a part of Real-time Control Systems (RCS) library
developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

This repository only contains the posemath part so it can be reused in
non-NML related applications.

The original source is modified to compile with a simple makefile and
without the need for autoconf tools.
